# Gnome terminal theme compilation

tl;dr
-----

Python script to batch-create multiple profiles for new gnome terminal using
dconf, based on ini specifications. Many themes (TODO) included.

Why
---

After much deliberation, the only theme for Gnome3.8 Terminal I could install without
excruciating pains and casual torture was the infamous Solarized theme.
So, let's port some of the existing themes for dconf, i.e., new gnome terminal.
And while we are at it, let's include conversions of various themes from iTerm and
so on.

Basic idea
----------

Save every theme in large ini file, theme is defined by for params:

- foreground color;
- background color;
- bold color;
- theme color palette.

The whole procedure consists of translating those themes into dconf profiles:

- creating new profile with unique id (otherwise, it won't work at all);
- updating list of active profiles, including new ones;
- setting profile variables based on ini file contents.

And voil√†, we've got ourselves gnome terminal with a whole load of themes! 
Probably much more than we originally wanted...

Additional functionality
------------------------

It would be great to batch-remove themes based on profile names and so on.
